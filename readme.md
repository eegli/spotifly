# Spotifly

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/eegli/spotifly/CI)

Spotifly is work in progress. It joins my currently independent Spotify related packages into a monorepo.

I'm a little busy now but plan to release the first major/initial versions for each package somewhere in June/July. ⚒️

Please do not use any of the packages from @spotifly yet, they are still lacking important security patches.

## CLI

Run `yarn spotifly`
