In order to access Spotify's data, you will need a dedicated Spotify application (and, of course, a Spotify account).

If you don't have one already, click the link below and create one. It's free!

## Getting an access token

Some of the packages require a short-lived user token. The helper below can be used to generate such a token that is bound to your Spotify application. Packages that require a token will list what scopes are needed.

Previously generated tokens are saved locally in your browser as long as their are valid (1h).

import { AuthTokenForm } from '@site/src/components/auth-token/form';

<AuthTokenForm />
