In order to access Spotify's data, you will need a dedicated Spotify application (and, of course, a Spotify account).

If you don't have one already, click the link below and create one. It's free!

[https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

## OAuth flows and Tokens

There are multiple ways to authorize with Spotify. We're only interested in two of them: `Implicit Grant Flow` and `Authorization Code Flow`. Both of these methods eventually let us access user-related data on Spotify.

- Implicit Grant Flow
- Authorization Code Flow

For more info, [read the docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/).

WIP Such a token can only be generated in the browser and expires after one hour

After having created your application, click _edit_ and add the following two redirect URLs:

- `https://spotifly.nougat.dev/docs/authorization`
- `http://localhost:3000` (optional)

:::info

Having the first URL whitelisted as redirect URL enables you to easily get both short and long-lived tokens directly on this page using the helper below.

The second URL is needed when you want to generate an access (and refresh) token locally (_Authorization Code Flow_). Such tokens are generally used in apps that run in an independent environment. The `auth-token` package needs a localhost URL to work.

For more information about Spotify's different types of Authorization, [refer to their docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/).

## Getting an access token

In order to authenticate with Spotify, most Spotifly packages need an access token. The helper below can be used to generate such a token that is bound to your Spotify application. Packages that require a token will list what scopes are needed.

Previously generated tokens are saved locally in your browser for as long as they are valid (one hour).

import { AuthTokenForm } from '@site/src/components/auth-token/form';

<AuthTokenForm />
