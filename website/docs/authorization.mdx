In order to access Spotify's data, you will need a dedicated Spotify application (and, of course, a Spotify account). If you don't have one already, click the link below and create one. It's free!

- [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

After having created your application, click _edit_ and add the following two redirect URLs:

- `https://spotifly.nougat.dev/docs/authorization`
- `http://localhost:3000` (optional)

:::info

Whitelisting the first URL enables you to create both short-lived access and long-lived refresh tokens directly on this page using the helper below.

The second URL is needed when you want to generate a long-lived token locally (_Authorization Code Flow_). You don't have to add it in your Spotify application. It's only needed when you want to use the `auth-token` package.

## Supported Grant Flows and Tokens

Spotify implements the [OAuth 2.0 authorization framework](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749). Out of all authorization flows, we're particularly interested in two of them: `Implicit Grant Flow` and `Authorization Code Flow`. Both of these methods eventually let us access user-related data on Spotify. Below is an excerpt from the [Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/) (_May 2022_).

### Implicit Grant Flow

_The implicit grant flow is carried out on the client side and it does not involve secret keys. Thus, you do not need any server-side code to use it. Access tokens issued are short-lived with no refresh token to extend them when they expire_.

### Authorization Code Flow

_The authorization code flow is suitable for long-running applications (e.g. web and mobile apps) where the user grants permission only once._

In short:

- The _Authorization Code Flow_ involves exchanging a client secret. It generates both a short-lived access and long-lived _refresh_ token that can be used to independently renew the access token.
- The _Implicit Grant Flow_ does not include and secrets. It can only be carried out in a browser. The result is a short-lived _access token_.

## Getting an access token

In order to authenticate with Spotify, most packages need a (short-lived) access token. If you're unsure what you need, _Implicit Grant_ is a good start! Tokens obtained from this flow expire after one hour and do not require the exchange of any secrets.

These short-lived tokens are saved locally in this browser as long as they are valid. If you select the _Authorization Code Flow_, the generated **refresh token** will **not** be saved in your browser. Copy it before you leave the page!

Last but not least, note that all packages that require a token will list what scopes are needed.

import { AuthTokenForm } from '@site/src/components/auth-token/form';
