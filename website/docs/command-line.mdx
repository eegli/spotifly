# Command Line

## Installing the CLI

Spotifly's wrapper CLI can be installed globally. It ships with the latest versions of all executables from this project.

```bash
yarn global add @spotifly/cli
```

```bash
npm install -g @spotifly/cli
```

Then:

```bash
spotifly [package] [args...]
```

## Usage with NPX / Yarn DLX

Instead of installing the CLI, every package can also be invoked directly with `npx`. This will download and save the executable in npm's local cache but not permanently add it to the PATH. [How NPX works](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx).

```bash
npx @spotifly/auth-token@latest [...args]
```

Alternatively, if you're in a workspace that uses [Yarn Berry](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dlx), you can use `yarn dlx`.

```bash
yarn dlx @spotifly/auth-token@latest [...args]
```

:::tip

If a package is invoked with `npx` and not in the cache, a prompt will ask you to install it. You can suppress the prompt by adding `--yes` right after `npx`. This is useful if you want to run any command in a CI/CD environment.

```bash
npx --yes @spotifly/auth-token@latest [...args]
```

## Version and help

Invoke any command with no arguments to see the version and available commands. This is equivalent to passing the `--help` flag. Of course, the classic `--version` flag is supported as well.

```bash
# CLI installed
spotifly

# From NPM
npx @spotifly/cli --version
```
