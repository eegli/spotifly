The core lib can be mocked nicely with [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/) and the TypeScript-friendly [`jest-mock-extended`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-mock-extended) extension. The following examples assume you have already setup `Jest` accordingly for your project.

1. Install `jest-mock-extended`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -D jest-mock-extended
```

2. Mock whatever methods you are using - the mocked functions are strongly typed. WIP
