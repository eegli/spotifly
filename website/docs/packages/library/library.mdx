## Motivation

This package allows you to easily export your Spotify library to JSON. Each track can be enriched with the genres of its artists and its audio features (Spotify does not assign a genre to each track but rather to most artists, which thereforce act as a proxy).

In order to access your library, you will need an access token from Spotify. You can get one from right [here.](/docs/authorization)

## CLI Usage

Create your custom command using the query builder below and paste it into your terminal.

import { CliCodeBlock } from '@site/src/components/code-blocks/codeblock';

<CliCodeBlock
  cli="spotifly library"
  npx="npx @spotifly/cli@latest library"
  commandMap={{
    token: 'token',
    type: ['light', 'full'],
    outDir: '',
    genres: false,
    features: false,
    compact: false,
  }}
  required={['token']}
/>

### Options

| Flag         | _(required?)_ Description                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--token`    | ✅ A Spotify user access token. Requires at least the scope "user-library-read" |
| `--type`     | ❌ Output type per track. Either `full` or `light`. Default: `light`            |
| `--genres`   | ❌ Include artist genres for each track. Default: `false`                       |
| `--features` | ❌ Include audio features for each track. Default: `false`                      |
| `--compact`  | ❌ Output more compact/minified JSON and save disk space. Default: `false`      |
| --outDir     | ❌ Custom relative output directory. Default: Current directory                 |

## Output

A `light` track has a reduced set of properties:

```ts
type TrackLight = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  album: {
    name: string;
    id: string;
  };
  artists: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  }[];
};
```

The `full` has all the track properties from the Spotify API. The next page features an example of both outputs.
