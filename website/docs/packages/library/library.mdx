## Motivation

This package allows you to easily export your Spotify library to JSON. Each track can be enriched with the genres of its artists and its audio features (Spotify does not assign a genre to each track but rather to most artists, which thereforce act as a proxy).

In order to access your library, you will need an access token from Spotify. You can get one from right [here.](/docs/authorization)

## CLI Usage

Create your custom command using the query builder below and paste it into your terminal.

import { CliCodeBlock } from '@site/src/components/code-blocks/codeblock';

<CliCodeBlock
  cli="spotifly library"
  npx="npx @spotifly/cli@latest library"
  accessToken={''}
  args={{
    type: ['light', 'full'],
    since: '',
    last: '',
    'out-dir': '',
  }}
  flags={{
    genres: false,
    features: false,
    compact: false,
  }}
/>

Note that if both `--last` and `--since` are set, whatever condition is met first will exhaust the procedure.

## Output

A `light` track has a reduced set of properties:

```ts
type TrackLight = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  album: {
    name: string;
    id: string;
  };
  artists: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  }[];
};
```

Type `full` has all track properties as they come from the Spotify API. The next page features an example of both outputs.
